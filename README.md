## Important: Running test cases

Some of our tests require the seed to be a constant value (1000).
You can launch the application with a constant seed as follows:
`./qwirkle 1000 < file.input > file.output` (ensure to pass in 1000)

There is also a [python script](run_all_tests.py) which helps automate testing.
If you are in a linux environment run:
```bash
python run_all_tests.py
-- or --
python3 run_all_tests.py
```
